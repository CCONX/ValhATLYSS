ValhATLYSS 0.4.14

BETA 4 IS HERE!

NOW you no longer have to worry about losing your progress across non modded servers and modded servers alike! Yes you can now KEEP your extra levels for NO ADDED COST! WOW! YIPPEE!

ValhATLYSS raises ATLYSSâ€™s max level to 64, extends the EXP curve beyond 32 with the same late-game slope, and preserves the original rewards cadence: +3 attribute points every level and +4 skill points every other level. Built to survive reloads and updates with a reflection-only approach (no risky IL patches).

This is my first mod quite literally ever, so, expect it to be at least a little buggy. That being said, if any bugs are found or any issues, feel free to let me know.

Features:

* Redux to lvl MAX (32 -> 64)
* EXP curve extended past 32 to preserve vanilla-like feel
* Lvl rewards kept in line with vanilla
* Character stat backups to prevent level loss

Requirements:

* BepInEx (you should already have this if youre here anyways)
* ATLYSS build 102025.a3 (as of date of publish)
* Required both client and server side for multiplayer

Known issues:

* Currently mod only restores saved levels, stats are reset and need to be readjusted every time character gets reset
* Currently its possible to bug the mod to get infinite skill points (but... why would you go through that effort anyways?)
* Experience may bug when getting levels back, resulting in some lost progress to the next level

ToDo:
* ?? Config file so lvl max can be manually designated
* * ?? Add custom exp curve to config file
(Due to concerns over how character stat syncing would work with differing level caps, a configurable option is currently on hold and possibly not happening.)
* Custom lib to allow modders to assign weapons higher than max lvl values
* Check exp req balancing and further test
* Edit exp given by mobs to allow for easier lvling past 32
* Sleep
* More sleep
* I really need sleep
